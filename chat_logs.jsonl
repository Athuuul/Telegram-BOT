It mostly involved barking.\n\nThis time, however, the squirrel, emboldened by weeks of acorn-hoarding success, dropped an acorn directly *on* Barnaby's head. Something clicked. Barnaby, in a moment of profound clarity, realized that barking alone wasn't cutting it. He started digging, strategically placing himself between the tree and the acorn stash. The squirrel, utterly baffled by this sudden shift in tactics, retreated. Barnaby, triumphant, buried the acorn, and promptly forgot about it, returning to his crumb-finding duties.

Tell her why you love her and why you want to spend your life with her.\n6.  **The Ring:** If you're using one, make sure it's something she'll love. If you're unsure, maybe propose without it and choose one together.\n7.  **Capture the Moment:** Arrange for a photographer or videographer to discreetly capture the proposal.\n8.  **Be Yourself:** Authenticity is what matters most.\n\nGood luck!
